Chest X-Rays of COVID-19 patients have proved to be an important alternative indicator in COVID-19 screening. But again, accuracy depends upon radiological expertise. A diagnosis recommender system that can assist the doctor to examine the lung images of the patients will reduce the diagnostic burden of the doctor. Deep Learning techniques specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have proven successful in medical imaging classification. Four different deep CNN architectures were investigated on images of chest X-Rays for diagnosis of COVID-19.
